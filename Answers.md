- [ ] Explain benefit(s) using `client-side routing`?
> Answer: Client-side routing is beneficial because it renders views from different routes faster due to not needing to request data from a server since it is all loaded at once into the browser. It also is beneficial because you do not need to render full page refreshes, instead you can rendere only data that needs updated for the new route. For example, you would not need to update the header and footer sections of a site to update the data displayed in the body of the page.
